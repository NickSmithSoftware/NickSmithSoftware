# More About Me

I enjoy competition, overly object oriented robust code, golfing, eSports, puzzles, and programming languages with good error logging.

In my free time I like building PC's and printing random things with my 3D printer.

Occasionally I fish or hunt with my family.

I love thrills even though I have a fear of heights so I try to visit theme parks as much as I can for the fantasy and entertainment.
